# IntelliSilo (Environment Control and UV Decontamination system for grains ECUDSG)
- ABOUT THE PROJECT
  - We can build a smart warehouse where we can 
implement an environment control and ultraviolet light decontamination system for survillance of 
the food grains. This system can be easily implemented with the help of current technology like 
embedded systems and IoT. Embedded systems can be used for measuring environmental factors 
like temperature, humidity, gas concentrations, etc. Than the gained data can be used to regulate the 
environment of the food grains. With the help of IoT this data can be send to google sheets and then 
can be distributed among scientists for analytics work.
  - NEED FOR THIS SYSTEM <br>
    India is a major producer of food grains, but about one-third of its food grains are wasted due to 
improper warehouses and storage. Due to improper infrastructure indian warehouse lacks the 
necessary condition for food storage. Due to improper hygiene grains are infected with pests and 
insects. Improper fumigation with gases like PH3 also affects the health of the workers. An 
environment control and UV decontamination system for food grains can be added in current 
warehouses that can improve the lifetime of these food grains.
