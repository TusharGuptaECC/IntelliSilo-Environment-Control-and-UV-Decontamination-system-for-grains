# IntelliSilo (Environment Control and UV Decontamination system for grains ECUDSG)
- About the project
  - We can build a smart warehouse where we can 
implement an environment control and ultraviolet light decontamination system for survillance of 
the food grains. This system can be easily implemented with the help of current technology like 
embedded systems and IoT. Embedded systems can be used for measuring environmental factors 
like temperature, humidity, gas concentrations, etc. Than the gained data can be used to regulate the 
environment of the food grains. With the help of IoT this data can be send to google sheets and then 
can be distributed among scientists for analytics work.
