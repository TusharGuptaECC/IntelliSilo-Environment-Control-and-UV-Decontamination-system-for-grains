# IntelliSilo (Environment Control and UV Decontamination system for grains ECUDSG)

- ABOUT THE PROJECT
  - We can build a smart warehouse where we can 
implement an environment control and ultraviolet light decontamination system for survillance of 
the food grains. This system can be easily implemented with the help of current technology like 
embedded systems and IoT. Embedded systems can be used for measuring environmental factors 
like temperature, humidity, gas concentrations, etc. Than the gained data can be used to regulate the 
environment of the food grains. With the help of IoT this data can be send to google sheets and then 
can be distributed among scientists for analytics work.

  - NEED FOR THIS SYSTEM <br>
    India is a major producer of food grains, but about one-third of its food grains are wasted due to 
improper warehouses and storage. Due to improper infrastructure indian warehouse lacks the 
necessary condition for food storage. Due to improper hygiene grains are infected with pests and 
insects. Improper fumigation with gases like PH3 also affects the health of the workers. An 
environment control and UV decontamination system for food grains can be added in current 
warehouses that can improve the lifetime of these food grains. Like for example in case of wheat humidity shold be less than 10% otherwise chances of 
getting moulds are very high. In summer temperature should be around 18 degrees and winter it 
should be around 25 degrees.

   - SCALABILITY <br>
In India, we have large warehouses for food grain storage where grains are stored in jute bags or 
sometimes store in large heaps. Currently, this design has one sensor for temperature, one for 
humidity, and two for gas concentrations. But for large warehouses, we have to increase the number 
of sensors.

  - FEATURES <br>
    - Temperature monitor and Control
    - Humidity Mointor and Control
    - Gas concentration monitor and alert system
    - UV decontamination
    - Security & Human disaster management system for fumigation problems

  - DESCRIPTION <br>
   - The IntelliSilo system can be connected to temperature regulation units to maintain proper temperature, and the same can be done for humidity control as well.
   - This system is designed for storing grains in an open environment (not in bags) and includes the decontamination of grains by exposing them to UV rays for predefined intervals.
   - The system is connected to the internet and can send sensor data to Google Sheets for further analytics.
   - It provides security by placing the main PCB outside the warehouse, allowing workers to view all sensor data on the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) display. Any necessary settings changes, such as temperature and humidity thresholds, can be made from this control panel (main PCB).
   - The system includes a login and authentication feature to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Password authentication is also required for making changes to crucial settings.
   - After fumigation, the system measures the concentration of PH3 gas and notifies the worker when it is safe to enter the warehouse.
   - The uniqueness of this solution lies in its decontamination facility using UV light. While most systems only monitor the environment and generate alerts, the IntelliSilo system actively regulates the environment itself and alerts the worker if human intervention is required. UV-C (germicidal ultraviolet light) can effectively kill various microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, mold, mildew, and fungi.
