# IntelliSilo (Environment Control and UV Decontamination system for grains ECUDSG)

- ABOUT THE PROJECT
  - We can build a smart warehouse where we can 
implement an environment control and ultraviolet light decontamination system for survillance of 
the food grains. This system can be easily implemented with the help of current technology like 
embedded systems and IoT. Embedded systems can be used for measuring environmental factors 
like temperature, humidity, gas concentrations, etc. Than the gained data can be used to regulate the 
environment of the food grains. With the help of IoT this data can be send to google sheets and then 
can be distributed among scientists for analytics work.

  - NEED FOR THIS SYSTEM <br>
    India is a major producer of food grains, but about one-third of its food grains are wasted due to 
improper warehouses and storage. Due to improper infrastructure indian warehouse lacks the 
necessary condition for food storage. Due to improper hygiene grains are infected with pests and 
insects. Improper fumigation with gases like PH3 also affects the health of the workers. An 
environment control and UV decontamination system for food grains can be added in current 
warehouses that can improve the lifetime of these food grains.

Like for example in case of wheat humidity shold be less than 10% otherwise chances of 
getting moulds are very high. In summer temperature should be around 18 degrees and winter it 
should be around 25 degrees.

 - SCALABILITY <br>
In India, we have large warehouses for food grain storage where grains are stored in jute bags or 
sometimes store in large heaps. Currently, this design has one sensor for temperature, one for 
humidity, and two for gas concentrations. But for large warehouses, we have to increase the number 
of sensors.

- FEATURES <br>
 - Temperature monitor and Control
 - Humidity Mointor and Control
 - Gas concentration monitor and alert system
 - UV decontamination
 - Security & Human disaster management system for fumigation problems

- DESCRIPTION <br>
The ECUDSG can be connected to the temperature regulation units to maintain the proper 
temperature, the same can be done for humidity also. This system works when grains are stored in 
the open(not in bags) as it also performs the decontamination of grains by exposing them to UV rays 
for short(pre-defined) intervals of time. The system is connected to the internet and can send the 
sensor data to google sheets for further analytics work.
It also provides security as the main PCB is connected outside the warehouse so workers don't have 
to go inside and check as all sensor data will be shown on the human-machine interface(HMI) 
display itself. If she wants to change any setting then like temperature and humidity thresholds it is 
also be done from this control pannel(main PCB).
This system comes with login and authentication so any unauthenticated person can't enter the 
warehouse. For making the change in any crucial settings also password is required.
After fumigation, this system will also tell the worker when she can enter a warehouse by 
measuring the concentration of PH3 gas. 
The uniqueness of this solution is that it comes with a decontamination facility with UV light. Most 
of the systems implemented today only monitor the environment and then generate the alert but 
ECUDSG first tries to regulate the environment itself and then informs the worker if human 
intervention is required. As we already know UV-C (germicidal ultraviolet light can be used to kill 
various micro-organisms like bacteria, viruses, mold, mildew, and fungi).
